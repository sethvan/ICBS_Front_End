# Front End for ICBS Website

After experimenting with [Editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) in this [test project](https://github.com/sethvan/react_editorjs_test)
I decided to implement it as a CMS for my local church so that they could have a website
where they could display and share content. This is the front end for their site. To update
site I modify here and then run build, paste to [back end](https://github.com/sethvan/IglesiaCristianaBautistaSinai), push back end to GitHub and pull
from GitHub inside of Digital Ocean Droplet.
